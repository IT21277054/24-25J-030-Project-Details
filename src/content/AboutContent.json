Students must complete this module in teams of 4, with each team having a supervisor and a co-supervisor, both SLIIT lecturers.\n\nThe project must align with a category included in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).\n\nThroughout the year, students are required to complete several key milestones to ensure steady progress. These milestones serve as checkpoints where students present their work, receive feedback, and adjust their approach as needed.\n\nAt the end of the project, students must deliver a well-developed product that demonstrates practical, real-world value and addresses a meaningful problem.\n\nSupervisors and co-supervisors provide ongoing guidance and support to students throughout the project, helping them refine their ideas, troubleshoot challenges, and maintain a high standard of quality.",
