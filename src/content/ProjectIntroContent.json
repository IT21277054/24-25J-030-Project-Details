  "text": "The Water Quality Prediction and Management System is designed to address the challenges of monitoring and managing the water quality of the Mahaweli River, a crucial water source for Sri Lanka. This innovative system aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of water quality management for internal use by the Sri Lanka Water Board. The system integrates a SCADA-based dashboard, providing real-time sensor data, including key water quality parameters such as pH, conductivity, and turbidity. In addition to real-time monitoring, the system incorporates an advanced water quality prediction model that forecasts raw water quality, offering proactive insights into potential issues.The systemâ€™s notification feature ensures that stakeholders are immediately alerted to any changes in water quality, enabling timely intervention. Furthermore, the chemical prediction system predicts the necessary chemicals for water purification, ensuring that the water treatment process is both efficient and effective. The system also includes flow customization capabilities, allowing users to tailor purification processes and predict key parameters at each stage of treatment. By combining real-time data, predictive analytics, and a user-friendly interface, this system provides a comprehensive solution for managing water quality, ensuring the sustainability and safety of Sri Lanka's water resources."
