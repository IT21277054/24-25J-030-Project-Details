The Water Board is no exception to this trend. In collaboration with the Research and Development Centre in Meewatura, we are supporting this digital transformation by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies and utilizing valuable data from the Mahaweli River. While the Water Board has access to a vast amount of data and relevant sensors to collect it, there is currently no effective way to process, visualize, or make use of this growing dataset. Despite the availability of data collection tools, there is a clear gap in the efficient management and analysis of this data.</p><p>To address these challenges, we are developing an advanced water quality management system that will integrate seamlessly with the existing SCADA system used by the Water Board. This integration will harness the existing sensors to collect real-time data and incorporate predictive models for water quality, with a focus on critical parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity, and the chemical usage predictions for Lime, Chlorine, and PAC. The system will also offer a step-wise prediction feature, allowing users to customize water treatment steps based on real-time data, further enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.</p><p>As part of the development process, we will review the current sensors being utilized by the Water Board, assessing their capabilities and how they can be effectively integrated into the new system. In addition, we will explore relevant architectures such as the publisher-subscriber model, which will be foundational for ensuring seamless data flow and efficient sensor integration within the system.</p><p>Currently, the Water Board lacks a unified software platform for managing sensors and visualizing data. Data processing is done manually in Excel sheets, and there is no centralized interface for sensor management, which creates inefficiencies and increases the potential for errors. Recognizing these challenges, the Water Board has requested a comprehensive dashboard that can consolidate these functionalities, streamline data processing, and reduce the need for human intervention. A similar system has been proposed by the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Munster, in their article \u201cSemantically Enabled Sensor Plug & Play for the Sensor Web.\u201d This paper discusses a Sensor Plug & Play infrastructure designed to minimize human interaction, which, although different in its technology and sensor setup, offers valuable insights. These insights will guide the development of a tailored solution for the Water Board, optimizing sensor management, data processing, and ultimately the water quality management process.</p>"},{"title":"RESEARCH PROBLEM","content":"<p><strong>No Unified Dashboard:</strong> The current water quality management system lacks a unified dashboard to visualize and interpret the data effectively. The data collected by various sensors is not consolidated in a single interface, making it challenging for decision-makers to access real-time information, trends, and alerts. A dedicated dashboard would streamline data presentation, empowering the team to monitor water quality and system performance more efficiently, facilitating better decision-making and timely interventions.</p><p><strong>No Predictive Capabilities:</strong> Currently, there is no way to predict water quality or anticipate potential issues before they arise. The system relies on reactive approaches, which makes it difficult to address problems proactively. There is also no predictive model in place to forecast water quality levels, chemical usage, or system performance, leaving the water board unable to predict changes in water quality or resource needs in advance.</p><p><strong>No Backup System, Other Than Physical Measures:</strong> The current system lacks an automated backup solution for critical failures. If issues arise, such as sensor malfunctions or system failures, there is no automated process in place to alert or recover from these events beyond physical intervention. This exposes the system to risks related to human error and delays in responding to failures, which can compromise water quality management and operational efficiency.</p><p><strong>Dependence on SCADA for Data Analysis:</strong> The SCADA system is the only method currently available for data analysis and water quality monitoring. While SCADA is crucial for gathering and displaying data, it lacks the advanced analytics and predictive capabilities necessary to optimize water quality management. The absence of supplementary systems or analytical tools limits the water board\'s ability to make informed decisions based on comprehensive data insights and predictions.</p>"},{"title":"RESEARCH GAP","content":"<p>When considering the research gap, even with the existing solutions and researches the main issue would be that none of it is tailored towards the specific requirements of the water board.

This integration will support data-driven decisions and provide the water board with a centralized platform to monitor water quality parameters effectively.</p><p><b>Water Quality Prediction System.</b><br /><br />A predictive system to forecast water quality levels based on real-time data gathered from the SCADA system. This system will use machine learning or statistical models to predict potential changes in water quality, allowing the water board to anticipate and address issues proactively before they affect the water supply.</p><p><b>Chemical Usage Prediction System.</b><br /><br />A system designed to predict the amount of chemicals required for water treatment. This system will analyze data related to water quality and historical chemical usage, allowing for more accurate predictions and optimizing the resource allocation for chemical treatment. This will help reduce waste, enhance the efficiency of water treatment processes, and improve cost-effectiveness.</p><p><b>Flow Management System with Customization.</b><br /><br />A system designed to monitor and manage the flow of water across different plants. This system will integrate real-time data from SCADA, predictive models, and historical trends to optimize water flow management. Additionally, it will allow users to customize the water quality process by adjusting parameters and steps according to specific needs, ensuring efficient and adaptable water distribution across different plants.</p><p><b>An SMS service that notifies the relevant users within the water board.</b><br /><br />A service that can send notifications when any issue is detected within the SCADA system, alerting the relevant personnel within the water board so they can take immediate corrective actions.

A middleware layer will be developed to ensure smooth data flow from SCADA to the new system. It will also be essential to ensure compatibility with the communication protocols used by the SCADA system, such as Modbus and OPC, to ensure seamless data transfer.</p><p><strong>Real-Time Dashboard Development:</strong> A core feature of the system is the real-time updating dashboard. This dashboard will display key water quality parameters, chemical predictions, and alerts. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive, incorporating visual elements like gauges, charts, and alarms, which will allow users to easily interpret the data and monitor the water quality trends in real time.</p><p><strong>Predictive Analytics and Model Integration:</strong> To enhance the water quality management system, machine learning models will be integrated to predict water quality parameters based on both historical and real-time data sourced from the SCADA system. Additionally, models will be developed to predict chemical consumption, such as lime, chlorine, and PAC, based on real-time water quality. A water quality prediction model will forecast future trends, helping stakeholders take proactive measures. Furthermore, a stepwise prediction model will be created that allows users to customize the prediction steps, tailoring the system to specific operational needs or scenarios.</p><p><strong>Deployment and Pilot Testing:</strong> Once the system is developed and integrated, a pilot deployment will be carried out at the Development Centre, Meewatura. This will ensure that the SCADA integration is functioning properly, and any issues or adjustments required will be identified.
